# TDE---text-decode-and-encode-script
This script provides a method for encoding and decoding messages using a custom seed phrase. Designed for anonymizing communications over non-secure messengers, it allows users to exchange messages privately even on platforms with limited security features. Only individuals who know the seed phrase can decode the encoded messages.
